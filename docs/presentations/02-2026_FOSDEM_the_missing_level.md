## Minute 0:00-1:00 | Opening

I want to start by being very explicit.

What I’m about to say is a deliberately sharpened argument.

Reality is more complex than what I will present.

But sharpening the argument helps us see a structural problem that often disappears in nuance.

So here is the claim I want to explore with you today: **EU open source policy fails locally - because it is designed for the wrong level.**

## Minute 1:00-3:30 | Argument 1 - The missing level

Europe builds digital policy in a multi-level system.

The EU sets ambitions.

National governments translate them into strategies.

Local governments are expected to implement.

This division of responsibility makes sense democratically.

It is also where implementation breaks down.

__Denmark is not unique in this.__

__Across Europe, the form differs - but implementation always happens locally, while responsibility and risk might be distributed.__

Local authorities are autonomous.

They carry responsibility for delivery.

But they often lack incentives, competencies, and protection against risk.

They are not unwilling.

They are constrained and focused on keeping existing systems running.

So open source becomes optional.

Digital sovereignty becomes aspirational.

And strategies remain documents rather than systems.

From my work in Denmark’s OS2 community, where more than 85% of municipalities collaborate on open source solutions, one insight stands out:

**If policy is not designed for the level that must act on it, it will fail regardless of intent.**

## Minute 3:30-6:30 | Argument 2 - Not a technology problem

In many public institutions, digitalisation is perceived as so complex that it is better left to others.

This creates a culture of distance rather than ownership.

Open source suffers as a consequence, because it is assumed to require even more competence and responsibility.

Out of this culture grows a convenient explanation: that open source fails because it is technically hard and that better packaging will solve the problem.

This explanation does not hold up when confronted with how public institutions already operate.

A typical Danish municipality already runs 400 to 600 IT systems.

Many are deeply integrated.

Of course many depend on proprietary platforms, often Microsoft-based.

This is not unique to Denmark.

This pattern repeats across Europe - in decentralised organisations, in centralised ones, and everywhere in between.

Complexity is not new.

It is already managed every day.

Replacing software is rarely the main challenge.

Transitioning organisations are.

for example digital workspaces in education.

The technology exists.

Open alternatives exist.

What really blocks change are incentives and risk. Who pays the price if it goes wrong?  
Governance, contracts, competence profiles, and leadership structures are set up to minimise blame - not to enable transition.

And there is another uncomfortable truth.

Large proprietary IT vendors are often invited into advisory roles.

They help define what is considered realistic.

They shape procurement culture.

When vendors define realism, sovereignty rarely follows.

So let me be clear:

**This is not a software problem. It is a governance, culture, and power problem.**

## Minute 6:30-8:30 | What needs to change

If Europe is serious about digital sovereignty, three things must change.

First:

**Risk-bearing public funding, with no strings attached.**

Local institutions need room to experiment, fail, and transition without being punished for taking responsibility.

Second:

**The EU must walk the talk.**

If open source and sovereign solutions are good enough for Europe, they must be good enough for EU institutions themselves.

Third:

**Every new public digital project must challenge the norm.**

Because right now, we are already deep in a hole and continuing as before only digs it deeper.

## Minute 8:30-9:00 | Closing

Digital sovereignty will not be delivered by better strategies.

It will be delivered when local institutions are actually able to act.

And until we design policy for that level,

we will keep producing documents - instead of systems.

Thank you.
