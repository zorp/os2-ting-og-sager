# The Missing Level: Why EU Open Source Fails Locally

## Minute 0:00-1:00 | Opening

I want to start by being very explicit.

What I'm about to say is a deliberately sharpened argument.

Reality is of course more complex than what I’m going to say.

That said, I believe that sharpening the argument helps us see a structural problem that often disappears in nuance.

What I share today draws from practical experience leading Denmark's OS2 collaboration - not from academic research, but from years of attempting to make open source work at local municipal scale.

The claim I want to explore today:

**European open source policy fails locally - because it is designed for the wrong level.**

## Minute 1:00–3:30 | Point 1 - The missing level

Europe builds digital policy in a multi-level system.

The EU sets ambitions.

National governments translate them into strategies.

Local governments are expected to implement.

This division of responsibility makes sense democratically.

But it is also where implementation often breaks down. This is where policy meets reality.

Denmark is not unique in this.

Across Europe, the form differs. But implementation and risk are pushed downward, while control remains upward.

I draw primarily from Danish experience in OS2 - but the pattern of misaligned responsibility appears structurally similar across decentralised systems in Europe.

Local authorities carry responsibility for delivery.

But they often lack incentives, competencies, and protection against risk.

They are not unwilling.

They are constrained - and focused on keeping existing systems running.

So open source becomes optional.

Digital sovereignty becomes aspirational.

And strategies remain documents rather than systems.

From my work in Denmark's OS2 community, where more than 85% of municipalities collaborate on open source solutions, one insight stands out:

If policy is not designed for the level that must act on it, it will fail regardless of intent.

## Minute 3:30–6:30 | Point 2 - Not a technology problem

In many public institutions, digitalisation is perceived as so complex that it is better left to others.

This creates a culture of distance rather than ownership.

Open source suffers as a consequence, because it is assumed to require even more competence and responsibility.

Out of this culture grows a convenient explanation: that the problem is technical quality rather than structural power.”

This explanation does not hold up when confronted with how public institutions already operate.

A typical Danish municipality already runs 300 to 500 IT systems.

Many are deeply integrated.

Of course many depend on proprietary platforms, often Microsoft-based.

This is not unique to Denmark.

This pattern repeats across Europe - in decentralised countries, in centralised ones, and everywhere in between

Complexity is not new.

It is already managed every day.

Replacing software is rarely the main challenge.

Transitioning organisations are.

Take the digital workspace.

Open alternatives exist.

But when the underlying infrastructure remains locked the workspace becomes a surface layer on top of deeper dependencies.

We are just changing what users see without changing what binds the organisation.

And this is not an accident.

Governance, contracts, competence profiles, and leadership structures are set up to minimise blame - not to enable transition.

And there is another uncomfortable truth.

Large IT vendors are often invited into advisory roles.

They help define what is considered realistic.

They shape procurement culture.

When vendors define realism, sovereignty rarely follows.

So let me be clear:

This is not a software problem.

It is a governance, culture, and power problem.

## Minute 6:30–8:30 | What needs to change

So if Europe is serious about digital sovereignty, policy must enable the level that implements - not just the level that decides.

That requires three shifts:

**Risk must be redistributed.**

Local actors cannot bear all implementation risk while having no control over strategy. They need room to experiment, fail, and transition without being punished for taking responsibility.

**EU institutions must demonstrate feasibility - must walk the talk.**

If open source and sovereign solutions are good enough for Europe, prove it works in Brussels first.

**New projects must become the exception that challenges the norm** **- stop doing what we have always done**.

Because right now, we are already deep in a hole and continuing as before only digs it deeper.

But we are still designing solutions for the level that must change, without involving that level in the conversation.

We are writing strategies. And every strategy assumes the implementation level will somehow figure it out.

It won't.

## Minute 8:30–9:30 | Closing

We know what needs to change.

The question is whether we are willing to stop treating open source as the solution - and start treating governance, risk, and power as the actual challenge.

Because right now, every new strategy, every new funding program, every new OSPO initiative assumes the missing level will somehow figure it out.

It won't.

So what will you do differently on Monday?

Will you write another strategy for sovereign cloud infrastructure?

Or will you ask: who bears the risk, who holds the power, and what structural conditions must change before any of this can work at scale?

Thank you.
